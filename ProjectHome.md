**QuickSynergy** is a graphical interface (GUI) for easily configuring [Synergy2](http://synergy2.sf.net/), an application that allows the user to share his mouse and keyboard between two or more computers.

Without the need for any external hardware, Synergy2 uses the [TCP-IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP) protocol to share the resources, even between machines with diferent operating systems, such as Mac OS, Linux and Windows.

So **QuickSynergy** is a graphical user interface for **Mac OS X** (Leopard only) and **Linux** systems, since the official website presents only a Windows version.
